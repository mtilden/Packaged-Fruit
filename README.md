-- Purpose: There will be two input streams to the program: 
-- one or more files specified in the command line and then standard input
-- The files specified in the command line will contain information on 
-- trees and samples. Read each of these files until end of file.
-- The input files will contain data on between one and one thousand 
-- trees, inclusive, and on between 0 and 20 samples per tree, also inclusive.
-- The information for each tree will be a sequence of items as follows:
-- The keyword "TREE".
-- A tree identification string of exactly 7 letters or digits.
-- After a tree identification string come a possibly empty sequence of
-- data on fruit samples. Each piece of fruit will be introduced by the
-- keyword "FRUIT", followed by three words to describe the 
-- following characteristics, in this order:
-- Size: small, midsize, large
-- Firmness: soft, firm, hard
-- Taste: bland, sweet, sour
-- A tree with a given ID number can appear more than once in the data.
 
-- Standard input will contain a sequence of commands that will direct
-- the program's output. These commands determine program output and operation, as follows:
--"Trees": Output only Tree id number and number of fruit samples
--"Averages": Output as in Trees, plus the average and standard 
-- deviation of each category for each tree.
--"Fruits": Output as in Trees, plus each fruit and average and standard deviation as in Averages
--"Tree ID": Output only Tree id number and number of fruit samples
--"Average ID": Output as in Trees, plus the average and standard
-- deviation of each category for the specified tree.
--"Fruit ID": Output as in Trees, plus each fruit and average and standard deviation as in Averages
--"Quit": Halt the program
